# Clean Architecture Project

## Introduction

This project follows **Clean Architecture**, aiming to build an application that is highly scalable, maintainable, and testable. The main modules of the project are **API**, **Application**, **Domain**, and **Infrastructure**, each serving a distinct role and responsibility in the overall system design.

Clean Architecture provides a framework that separates concerns, making it easier to modify, test, and scale applications. By organizing the system into these well-defined modules, we ensure that the core business logic is isolated from infrastructure concerns, allowing for easier maintenance and evolution of the system.

## Goals

- Build an application that is easy to **test**, **maintain**, and **scale**.
- Separate core **business logic** from external components like databases, frameworks, and APIs.
- Facilitate the **modification** of technologies and easy **upgrades** without breaking the core functionality.

## Clean Architecture Overview

### Components in the System:

1. **API**: This module handles communication with external clients (users or systems) via HTTP or other API protocols. It only depends on the **Application** and **Domain** layers and does not interact with the **Infrastructure** layer directly.
   
   - **Controllers** and **Endpoints**: These components receive requests from clients, call use cases in the **Application** layer to process the requests, and return the results to the client.
   - **Routing** and **API Responses**: Defines the endpoints and data structure for incoming and outgoing API calls.

2. **Application**: The **Application** layer contains the core business logic and orchestrates the use cases of the application. It interacts with the **API** layer to process requests and orchestrates the interaction with the **Domain** layer. In this layer, we define repository and service interfaces to abstract away technology-specific details that will be implemented in the **Infrastructure** layer.

   - **Use Cases**: These represent the core application workflows or business logic that the system supports.
   
   - **Repository Interfaces**: Defines methods required to interact with data. These interfaces are technology-agnostic and will be implemented in the **Infrastructure** layer.
   
   - **Service Interfaces**: Provides abstraction for the services, which will be implemented in the **Infrastructure** layer, allowing for easy modification of external interactions.

3. **Domain**: The **Domain** layer contains the core entities and business logic of the system. It is technology-agnostic and should not rely on any external dependencies (e.g., databases, frameworks, etc.). This layer contains the fundamental business rules of the system.
   
   - **Entities**: Represents the main objects in the system (e.g., User, Product). Entities are the foundation of business logic and can be reused across various applications or systems.
   
   - **Domain Services**: These encapsulate business rules that are not specific to any single entity and can span across multiple entities.

4. **Infrastructure**: This module contains the concrete implementations of the interfaces defined in the **Application** and **Domain** layers. It is responsible for connecting the core business logic to external systems, such as databases, third-party services, and APIs. 
   
   - **Repository Implementations**: The concrete implementations of repository interfaces, which handle the actual interaction with the database or other data storage systems.
   
   - **External Services**: Classes that implement communication with external systems (e.g., email services, third-party APIs) or infrastructure concerns like file systems.

   - **Migration**: The **Infrastructure** layer also handles the **AppDbContext** and migration-related configurations to manage the database schema.

### Folder Structure:

Here is the folder structure of the project, with the repository interfaces placed in the **Application** layer, and the corresponding implementations placed in the **Infrastructure** layer:
